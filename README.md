3) Specification:
    Requirements are documented in a clear manner; This documentation serves as a contract between stakeholders and developers, showing what the software is expected to do and how it should behave. Different techniques such as use cases, user stories, and formal requirement specifications may be used.

4) Validation:
    Ensures that requirements accurately reflect the needs and expectations of stakeholders and are able to be implemented within the project's timeline. 

5) Verification and Change Management: 
    Once requirements are validated, they need to be verified to ensure that the developed software meets the specified requirements; Any changes to requirements during the development process should be carefully managed to maintain project integrity.

    B) IMPORTANCE

1) Quality Assurance:
    Thorough requirements engineering contributes to the overall quality of the software by ensuring that it behaves as expected and meets the expected functionality, performance, and usability.

2) Risk Management: 
    Clear and well-defined requirements help identify potential risks and issues early in the development process, allowing for timely mitigation and reducing the likelihood of project failure.

3) Cost and Time Efficiency:
    By providing a clear roadmap for development, requirements engineering helps minimize rework, delays, and cost overruns associated with misunderstandings or changes in project scope.

4) Alignment with Stakeholder Needs:
    Proper requirements engineering ensures that the software meets the needs and expectations of its intended users and stakeholders, increasing user satisfaction.

5) Communication and Collaboration:
    Effective requirements engineering smoothens communication and collaboration among project stakeholders, giving a shared understanding of project goals and requirements.


Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

a) Modularity is the process of breaking down a complex system into smaller,independent and re-usable modules.

b) It improves maintainability and scalability by leaving changes to individual components thus promoting the re-use of components across projects enabling scalable architecture and facilitating parallel developemet. This leads to more efficient maintainence, easier scalability, clearer system understanding resulting in more adaptable software solutions

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). 

1) UNIT TESTING:
    Focuses on testing individual units or components of the software in isolation so as to clarify that each unit meets its expected functionality.

2) INTEGRATION TESTING:
    This tests the interactions and interfaces between different modules to verify that they work correctly and identify inconsistencies.

3) SYSTEM TESTING:
    Tests the entire system in a complete intergrated environment to make sure that it meets the requirements and standards from an end-to-end perspective.

4) ACCEPTANCE TESTING:
    Also known as the user acceptance testing, used to determine whether the software is acceptable for delivery and meets the business requirements and satisfies user needs.


Why is testing crucial in software development?
    So as to ensure quality, detect bugs early, mitigate risks, satisfy users, comply with regulations, and continuously improve the software. It gives deployment confidence and contributes to the overall success of the project.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

A) Version control systems, also known as source control, are software tools that aids in managing changes to code over time.They enable developers to work more efficiently, reduce errors and maintain codebases effectively over time.
